# Playphone Round 1

This is a Game made for the first round of #playphone on the Hack Club Slack! Playphone is a community made game where others will contribute to this game in rounds, and at the end of it all, we will have an extremely polished game.


As of now, I've implemented the base game, this includes:
- Layout for player, new levels, and menu
- Dying
- Trampoline
- Sprites
- More!
