# Playphone Round 1

This is a Game made for the first round of #playphone on the Hack Club Slack! Playphone is a community made game where others will contribute to this game in rounds, and at the end of it all, we will have an extremely polished game.

I started the first round to support my goat @Charmunk and because I'm really into game dev.

As of now, I've implemented the base game, this includes:
- Layout for player, new levels, and menu
- Dying
- Trampoline
- Sprites
- More!

## Controls

- **Move Left**: Left Arrow or A key
- **Move Right**: Right Arrow or D key
- **Jump**: Space or Enter key
